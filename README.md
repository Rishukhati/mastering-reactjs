> A hands-on learning journal documenting my React.js journey — from fundamentals to advanced concepts. Every folder represents a new day of practice, experimentation, and growth.

---

##  Purpose

This repository serves as my personal React.js learning space. The goal is to:

- Build a **strong foundation** in React concepts through daily practice
- **Track my progress** as I grow from beginner to confident React developer
- Create a **reference library** of working code examples I can revisit anytime
- Stay **consistent** and accountable in my learning journey

---

##  Repository Structure

Each folder represents a focused learning session, following a simple naming convention:

```
mastering-reactjs/
├── react101/    → JSX, Components, Props, defaultProps, PropTypes
├── react102/    → onClick, Event Handling
├── react103/    → onChange, Controlled Components
└── react10X/    → (continuing...)
```

Every folder contains:
-  Practice exercises
-  Concept implementations
-  Experiments and mini-projects

---

##  Curriculum Progress

| Session | Topics Covered | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| react101 | JSX, Components, Props, PropTypes, defaultProps, userGreeting |  Done |
| react102 | onClick, Event Handling |  Done |
| react103 | onChange, Controlled Components |  Done |
| react104 | Coming soon... |  In Progress |

##  Concepts Learned So Far

- **JSX** — Writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript
- **Functional Components** — Building reusable UI blocks
- **Props** — Passing data between components
- **PropTypes** — Validating component props
- **defaultProps** — Setting fallback prop values
- **Event Handling** — onClick, onChange and user interactions
- **Conditional Rendering** — Showing different UI based on state/props

---

##  Learning Resource

##  Getting Started

To run any project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rishukhati/mastering-reactjs.git

# Navigate to a session folder
cd react101/my-react

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
